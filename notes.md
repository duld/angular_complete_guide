# Angular Notes

## Pre-requisites

### Notes taken from [Angular Quickstart](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart)

### Angular Requires

* __node.js__ version 8.x or 10.x.
* __npm__ package manager.
* angular cli
  * __npm install -g @angular/cli__

### Creating a workspace

Angular apps are created in a context of an Angular __workspace__. A workspace contains the files for one or more __projects__. A __project__ is the set of files that comprise an app, a library, or end-to-end tests.

To Create a new workspace and initial app project.

```Shell

ng new my-app

```

### Serving the application

Angular includes a server, so that can easily build and serve your app locally.

```Shell

ng serve --open

```

#### TLDR 1

* Create a new app
  * __ng new my-app__
* Start the app
  * __ng serve --open__

## Angular vs Angular N

Angular 2 is a complete re-write of Angular 1. Angular version 4 and above is considered, "just Angular". Angular 1 is now called AngularJS. Each new version of Angular is just an incremental improment over the previous version.
