# Angular Complete Guide

## Purpose

This github repo is meant to help me track my progress as I make my way through the Angular Complete Guide course on Udemy. Angular looks like an interesting JS frame work and I look forward to going as deep as the course takes me.

## Q. Why have this on your github

I create a public repo to any course that I am taking. I like tracking my progress. And I can pull down my progress to any computer if something were to happen to my daily driver.
